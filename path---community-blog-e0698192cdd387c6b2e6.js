The BuckleScript author estimates that the build system should scale to a few hundred thousands files in the current condition.</li>\n<li>Messenger used to receive bugs reports on a daily basis; since the introduction of Reason, there have been a total of <strong>10 bugs</strong> (that\'s during the whole year, not per week)!</li>\n<li>Most of the messenger core team\'s new features are now developed in Reason.</li>\n<li>Dozens of massive refactors while iterating on ReasonReact. Refactoring speed went from days to hours to dozens of minutes. I don\'t think we\'ve caused more than a few bugs during the process (counted toward the total number of bugs).</li>\n<li>Everyone writing Reason got promoted for quality engineering. Just kidding.

The product teams\' and open source folks\' feedback has changed our strategy a few times, for the better. As of today, Reason and BuckleScript are also deployed on a WhatsApp internal tool, Instagram Web (small scale), plus some critical Ads internal tools. We\'ll be working closely with these teams over the next year.</p>\n<p>We\'ve successfully onboarded regular JavaScript folks to Reason; in the most extreme case, an intern with no JS knowledge was able to ship ReasonReact code in production (and made 0 bug while doing so). Give your own team a try! =)</p>\n<p>A big thanks to all these teams\' members, to Hongbo (BuckleScript author) and to the OCaml community (really, 50% Reason means 50% OCaml. We\'re nothing without you); and of course, to all of you folks in the community for being with us all this time. The best is yet to come.</p>\n<p>See you soon!</p>\n<h3 id="way-way-waaaay-nicer-error-messages"><a href="#way-way-waaaay-nicer-error-messages" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Way, Way, Waaaay Nicer Error Messages!</h3>\n<p><em>August 25, 2017</em></p>\n<p>A picture\'s worth a thousand words.</p>\n<p>Before:</p>\n<div style="width:744px">\n  <img alt="before" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1909539/29709302-ab0c6aee-8940-11e7-953f-60a867d242cb.png" />\n</div>\nAfter:\n<div style="width:742px">\n  <img alt="before" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1909539/29709301-ab04eac6-8940-11e7-8d2b-c65f808b6be8.png" />\n</div>\n<p>Sometimes when I\'m busy working, some random colleague/Discord member would ping me and tell me "Yo Cheng Lou why are Reason\'s errors so bad? Why can\'t you be more like <a href="http://elm-lang.org">Elm</a> Cheng Lou? Why? Look at how great Elm\'s errors are Cheng Lou, look."</p>\n<p>In reality I\'m pretty darn ashamed of our error messages; here we are, a type system with two decades of solid research and implementation, but sometimes presented to the end users as if it\'s something that\'d get in their way.</p>\n<p>No more! We\'ve heard you loud and clear, and delivered you much improved error messages! A few things we did:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Display the error-ing line(s), right inside the terminal.</li>\n<li>Better colors, for quicker visual search.</li>\n<li>Improved messages in many cases.</li>\n<li>Errors in Reason syntax for Reason files.</li>\n<li>A bit of breathing room between lines.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The last point is a tradeoff; errors end up taking more space. Seeing that you\'d usually focus on a single error rather than trying to get an overview of all errors, we\'ve deemed this tradeoff worthwhile, especially in the context of a big amount of build output. Considering the new warning format:</p>\n<div style="width:745px">\n  <img alt="warning-after" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1909539/29711739-431be094-894b-11e7-87a6-bc1d6aeea043.png" />\n</div>\nHere\'s the same warning, old version, buried among other outputs:\n<div style="width:745px">\n  <img alt="warning-before" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1909539/29711789-810739f8-894b-11e7-8451-a919b3f119c6.png" />\n</div>\n<p>At Messenger, we\'ve seen people ship warnings to production not because they didn\'t want to fix them, but because they\'ve <strong>missed them</strong>! It\'s not rocket science. Leave some negative space here and there. Color things appropriately. Voil√†!</p>\n<p><strong>The new errors can be turned on by adding <code>"bsc-flags": ["-bs-super-errors"]</code> to your bsconfig.json</strong>, <a href="https://github.com/reasonml-community/reason-react-example/blob/6dc15bf5fbeeb184c99acb063f7644a0d14b12f4/bsconfig.json#L3">like so</a>. They\'re also available for <a href="https://github.com/bsansouci/bsb-native">bsb-native</a>. True to our stack\'s spirit, they\'re fast, simple to configure, and solid.</p>\n<p><strong>One more thing</strong>: we\'re vertically integrated common pitfalls of <a href="//reasonml.github.io/reason-react/">ReasonReact</a> into these messages too, when applicable.</p>\n<div style="width:747px">\n  <img alt="reason-react" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1909539/29712284-f1013bb2-894d-11e7-9596-1cca54d5c331.png" />\n</div>\n<p>This is just the first of many iterations to come!
