title: Reason 3.2.0!
---

**This release is best used in conjunction with `bs-platform 3.1.4`**.

Rejoice! The release you've all been waiting for. This fixes three major pain points of the Reason formatter.

## Whitespace Tuning

Your empty lines between most things will now be preserved when you format your code! Multiple lines still collapse into one in most cases.

This also mean that those awkward, forced new lines refmt previously inserted between e.g. top-level statements are now gone too (unless you insert them yourself, naturally).

This change was very complex to implement; please thank [Iwan](https://twitter.com/_iwan_refmt), our `refmt` expert.

## Semicolon Relaxation

Ever gotten those cryptic syntax errors when you write this?

```reason
let a = 1
let b = 2
```

**We now gracefully accept this**! No more semicolon syntax errors.

However, for good measure, `refmt` will still print it into:

```reason
let a = 1;
let b = 2;
```

Because we're hesitant to recommend the former for now. Under the current syntax, some semicolons are still hard to remove completely. We'll keep working on this; in the meantime, do write in the latter style. If you forget a semicolon, `refmt` will  add it back.

This improvement is made by [Fred](https://twitter.com/let_def) (Merlin, Reason 3, and many others). Another very challenging change.

## Unicode String Printing

```reason
let message = "Hi! Unicode formats correctly now. Sorry for the wait ðŸ˜…"
```

Again, by Fred. Thanks!

As always, full list of changes [here](https://github.com/facebook/reason/blob/master/HISTORY.md#320). Enjoy!
