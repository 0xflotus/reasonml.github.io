title: Try Page Now Has Built-in ReasonReact Support
---

Our community member [@astrada](https://github.com/astrada) has helped us integrate ReasonReact's JSX and (runtime) library support into the [Try](/en/try.html) page! It wasn't a small feat, so thank you @astrada.

Now you can try any ReasonReact snippet in the playground and things should Just Work. Enjoy!
