### Much Better Playground

August 18, 2017

Based on popular feedback, we've now improved our online [Try](https://reasonml.github.io/try) section. Highlights:

- Bidirectional conversion. Write Reason, get OCaml translation, vice-versa.
- Live evaluation, with console feedback in the lower-right section.
- Most of the [standard library](/api/index.html) is now loaded. Since we're evaluating on the web, This includes BuckleScript's [extra stdlib APIs](https://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/api/).
- Sharable code snippet! Just copy the URL.
- Some performance improvements.

Have fun!

### New website!

July 14, 2017

Notice anything different? =)

The new documentation website is built by our community member [Jared](https://jaredforsyth.com) (make sure to check his Reason blog posts too!). The new site keeps most of the same content from the old one, while providing a better structure to navigate through them. You'll notice "Suggest an edit" links all over the place. Take a look around!

(Built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org))

### New ReasonReact version released

June 12, 2017

Very exciting release! Short version: ReasonReact now has its own documentation site [here](//reasonml.github.io/reason-react/). Accompanying this is the new [BuckleScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bs-platform) release. Both are non-breaking.

Enjoy!

### Spring Cleaning (First Blog Post!)

May 18, 2017

Now that the community is taking off, keeping folks up-to-date through [Discord](https://discord.gg/reasonml) and other existing channels became less ideal. We're starting a blog post section for this reason. In the spirit of the community, these posts will stay short and concise.

We've moved unused first-party projects from [GitHub/reasonml](https://github.com/reasonml/) to [GitHub/reasonml-old](https://github.com/reasonml-old). Old URLs are redirected, so no breackage here.

We've cleaned up the Reason codebase. Editor integrations moved out to their dedicated repos. Updated instructions are still [here](/guide/editor-tools/editors-plugins). Other Reason repo cleanups are still ongoing.

Some discord rooms got merged together. Fewer rooms, more focused discussions.

As you can see: this documentation site got a few rearrangements too. In general, if you'd like to contribute to docs, please ping us on Discord!
