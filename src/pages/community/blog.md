### Way, Way, Waaaay Nicer Error Messages!

*August 25, 2017*

A picture's worth a thousand words.

Before:
<div style="width:744px">
  <img alt="before" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1909539/29709302-ab0c6aee-8940-11e7-953f-60a867d242cb.png" />
</div>
After:
<div style="width:742px">
  <img alt="before" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1909539/29709301-ab04eac6-8940-11e7-8d2b-c65f808b6be8.png" />
</div>

Sometimes when I'm busy working, some random colleague/Discord member would ping me and tell me "Yo Cheng Lou why are Reason's errors so bad? Why can't you be more like [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) Cheng Lou? Why? Look at how great Elm's errors are Cheng Lou, look."

In reality I'm pretty darn ashamed of our error messages; here we are, a type system with two decades of solid research and implementation, but sometimes presented to the end users as if it's something that'd get in their way.

No more! We've heard you loud and clear, and delivered you much improved error messages! A few things we did:

- Display the error-ing line(s), right inside the terminal.
- Better colors, for quicker visual search.
- Improved messages in many cases.
- Errors in Reason syntax for Reason files.
- A bit of breathing room between lines.

The last point is a tradeoff; errors end up taking more space. Seeing that you'd usually focus on a single error rather than trying to get an overview of all errors, we've deemed this tradeoff worthwhile, especially in the context of a big amount of build output. Considering the new warning format:
<div style="width:745px">
  <img alt="warning-after" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1909539/29711739-431be094-894b-11e7-87a6-bc1d6aeea043.png" />
</div>
Here's the same warning, old version, buried among other outputs:
<div style="width:745px">
  <img alt="warning-before" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1909539/29711789-810739f8-894b-11e7-8451-a919b3f119c6.png" />
</div>

At Messenger, we've seen people ship warnings to production not because they didn't want to fix them, but because they've **missed them**! It's not rocket science. Leave some negative space here and there. Color things appropriately. Voil√†!

**The new errors can be turned on by adding `"bsc-flags": ["-bs-super-errors"]` to your bsconfig.json**, [like so](https://github.com/reasonml-community/reason-react-example/blob/6dc15bf5fbeeb184c99acb063f7644a0d14b12f4/bsconfig.json#L3). They're also available for [bsb-native](https://github.com/bsansouci/bsb-native). True to our stack's spirit, they're fast, simple to configure, and solid.

**One more thing**: we're vertically integrated common pitfalls of [ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/) into these messages too, when applicable.

<div style="width:747px">
  <img alt="reason-react" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1909539/29712284-f1013bb2-894d-11e7-9596-1cca54d5c331.png" />
</div>

This is just the first of many iterations to come! Got a message you'd like to see explained better? File an issue [here](https://github.com/reasonml-community/error-message-improvement/issues)!

Enjoy =)

### Much Better Playground

*August 18, 2017*

Based on popular feedback, we've now improved our online [Try](/try) section. Highlights:

- Bidirectional conversion. Write Reason, get OCaml translation, vice-versa.
- Live evaluation, with console feedback in the lower-right section.
- Most of the [standard library](/api/index.html) is now loaded. Since we're evaluating on the web, This includes BuckleScript's [extra stdlib APIs](https://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/api/).
- Sharable code snippet! Just copy the URL.
- Some performance improvements.

Have fun!

### New website!

*July 14, 2017*

Notice anything different? =)

The new documentation website is built by our community member [Jared](https://jaredforsyth.com) (make sure to check his Reason blog posts too!). The new site keeps most of the same content from the old one, while providing a better structure to navigate through them. You'll notice "Suggest an edit" links all over the place. Take a look around!

(Built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org))

### New ReasonReact version released

*June 12, 2017*

Very exciting release! Short version: ReasonReact now has its own documentation site [here](//reasonml.github.io/reason-react/). Accompanying this is the new [BuckleScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bs-platform) release. Both are non-breaking.

Enjoy!

### Spring Cleaning (First Blog Post!)

*May 18, 2017*

Now that the community is taking off, keeping folks up-to-date through [Discord](https://discord.gg/reasonml) and other existing channels became less ideal. We're starting a blog post section for this reason. In the spirit of the community, these posts will stay short and concise.

We've moved unused first-party projects from [GitHub/reasonml](https://github.com/reasonml/) to [GitHub/reasonml-old](https://github.com/reasonml-old). Old URLs are redirected, so no breakage here.

We've cleaned up the Reason codebase. Editor integrations moved out to their dedicated repos. Updated instructions are still [here](/guide/editor-tools/editors-plugins). Other Reason repo cleanups are still ongoing.

Some discord rooms got merged together. Fewer rooms, more focused discussions.

As you can see: this documentation site got a few rearrangements too. In general, if you'd like to contribute to docs, please ping us on Discord!
