title: Editor Plugins
---

Reason's nature lends itself to great editor support. Most of our editor plugins provides at minimum:

- Types display.
- Programmatic code formatting through `refmt`.
- Errors & warnings display.
- Syntax highlighting.
- Type-driven autocomplete.
- Jump to definition.

And other features.

## Officially Supported Editors

- [VSCode](https://github.com/jaredly/reason-language-server): **recommended**.
- [Vim/Neovim](https://github.com/reasonml-editor/vim-reason-plus)
- [Sublime Text](https://github.com/reasonml-editor/sublime-reason)
- [IDEA](https://github.com/reasonml-editor/reasonml-idea-plugin)

The two below are currently unmaintained; we're keeping the old instructions here, but we'd like to upgrade them to [reason-language-server](https://github.com/jaredly/reason-language-server) one day. Contribution welcome!

- [Atom](https://github.com/314eter/atom-ocaml-merlin)
  - [Atom-ide-reason](https://github.com/zaaack/atom-ide-reason).
  - Alternatively, if you use [Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/), Reason support comes by default.
