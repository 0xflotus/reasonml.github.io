One of our proudest moments is when a few Reason users told us privately (paraphrased):

> I don't like that recent decision we took, but I understand the goal of compromising X in order to make things easier for newcomers in the medium-term. In the meantime, I'll use my own work-around to patch X.

This section hosts some of the Reason & BuckleScript community idioms, and other meta-level concerns of everyday programming in the community.

Some of these guidelines require a bit of cooperation from you folks; the decisions made in them are **not** meant to be taken and interpreted individually and purely technically; they're deliberate trade-offs we need to make as a community in the medium-term.

On the other hand, as the community composition evolves and as we discover new opportunities, these guidelines **will** change accordingly. So please also don't interpret them as dogma or "best" practices; instead, consider them simply as convenience practices that unify and avoid otherwise churny discussions or processes (e.g. project layout, naming, publishing, etc.).

Thanks for your understanding!
