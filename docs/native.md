title: Native
---

We currently use the default OCaml workflow to compile to native, although [there's work underway](https://github.com/bsansouci/bsb-native) to bring native compilation support to the BuckleScript builder.

> **Note**: some parts of the native workflow likely don't work on Windows. The native workflow is currently **work in progress**, as we're currently focusing on polishing the JS workflow. Contribution welcome!

For native package management, we're testing [Esy](https://esy.sh).
