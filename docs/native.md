title: Native
---

We currently use the default OCaml workflow to compile to native, although [there's work underway](https://github.com/bsansouci/bsb-native) to bring native compilation support to the BuckleScript builder.

For native package management, we're testing [Esy](https://esy.sh).

> **Note**: Esy doesn't currently work on windows yet; we're working on it.
